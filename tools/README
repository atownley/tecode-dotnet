README for Tools
================

This directory contains snapshots of the tools required to
successfully build te-common.NET.  At the moment, it depends on the
nightly build of NAnt from the 28th of Sept, but I'm not sure for how
much longer.  I didn't have access to the previous version that I was
using (will be posted here soon), so I had to update.

This version of NAnt doesn't come with either NDoc or NUnit (which is
slightly annoying), but using NUnit 2.1 seems to work if you put the
appropriate assemblies in the right places in NAnt's bin directory.

NDoc is a non-runner at the moment, so I'm not really sure what to do
about that.  I gather from trying to make everything work that NAnt is
using a nightly build or other snapshot of NDoc, because none of the
versions I tried seems to work.

I'll post any extra tools you need to build this thing here as they
come available and try to keep everything up to date.
